Abstract

Imaging neuroscience links human behavior to aspects of brain biology in ever-
increasing datasets. Existing neuroimaging methods typically perform either dis-
covery of unknown neural structure or testing of neural structure associated with
mental tasks. However, testing hypotheses on the neural correlates underlying
larger sets of mental tasks necessitates adequate representations for the observa-
tions. We therefore propose to blend representation modelling and task classiﬁca-
tion into a uniﬁed statistical learning problem. A multinomial logistic regression
is introduced that is constrained by factored coefﬁcients and coupled with an au-
toencoder. We show that this approach yields more accurate and interpretable
neural models of psychological tasks in a reference dataset, as well as better gen-
eralization to other datasets.

Introduction

Methods for neuroimaging research can be grouped by discovering neurobiological structure or as-
sessing the neural correlates associated with mental tasks. To discover, on the one hand, spatial
distributions of neural activity structure across time, independent component analysis (ICA) is often
used [6]. It decomposes the BOLD (blood-oxygen level-dependent) signals into the primary modes
of variation. The ensuing spatial activity patterns are believed to represent brain networks of func-
tionally interacting regions [26]. Similarly, sparse principal component analysis (SPCA) has been
used to separate BOLD signals into parsimonious network components [28]. The extracted brain
networks are probably manifestations of electrophysiological oscillation frequencies [17]. Their
fundamental organizational role is further attested by continued covariation during sleep and anes-
thesia [10]. Network discovery by applying ICA or SPCA is typically performed on task-unrelated
(i.e., unlabeled) “resting-state” data. These capture brain dynamics during ongoing random thought
without controlled environmental stimulation. In fact, a large portion of the BOLD signal variation
is known not to correlate with a particular behavior, stimulus, or experimental task [10].
To test, on the other hand, the neural correlates underlying mental tasks, the general linear model
(GLM) is the dominant approach [13]. The contribution of individual brain voxels is estimated ac-
cording to a design matrix of experimental tasks. Alternatively, psychophysiological interactions
(PPI) elucidate the inﬂuence of one brain region on another conditioned by experimental tasks [12].
As a last example, an increasing number of neuroimaging studies model experimental tasks by train-
ing classiﬁcation algorithms on brain signals [23]. All these methods are applied to task-associated
(i.e., labeled) data that capture brain dynamics during stimulus-guided behavior. Two important
conclusions can be drawn. First, the mentioned supervised neuroimaging analyses typically yield
results in a voxel space. This ignores the fact that the BOLD signal exhibits spatially distributed

1

patterns of coherent neural activity. Second, existing supervised neuroimaging analyses cannot ex-
ploit the abundance of easily acquired resting-state data [8]. These may allow better discovery of the
manifold of brain states due to the high task-rest similarities of neural activity patterns, as observed
using ICA [26] and linear correlation [9].
Both these neurobiological properties can be conjointly exploited in an approach that is mixed
(i.e., using rest and task data), factored (i.e., performing network decomposition), and multi-
task (i.e., capitalize on neural representations shared across mental operations). The integra-
tion of brain-network discovery into supervised classiﬁcation can yield a semi-supervised learn-
ing framework. The most relevant neurobiological structure should hence be identiﬁed for
the prediction problem at hand. Autoencoders suggest themselves because they can emulate
variants of most unsupervised learning algorithms, including PCA, SPCA, and ICA [15, 16].
Autoencoders (AE) are layered learning models that con-
dense the input data to local and global representations
via reconstruction under compression prior. They behave
like a (truncated) PCA in case of one linear hidden layer
and a squared error loss [3]. Autoencoders behave like a
SPCA if shrinkage terms are added to the model weights
in the optimization objective. Moreover, they have the
characteristics of an ICA in case of tied weights and
adding a nonlinear convex function at the ﬁrst layer [18].
These authors further demonstrated that ICA, sparse au-
toencoders, and sparse coding are mathematically equiva-
lent under mild conditions. Thus, autoencoders may ﬂex-
ibly project the neuroimaging data onto the main direc-
tions of variation.
In the present investigation, a linear autoencoder will
be ﬁt to (unlabeled) rest data and integrated as a rank-
reducing bottleneck into a multinomial logistic regression
ﬁt to (labeled) task data. We can then solve the com-
pound statistical problem of unsupervised data represen-
tation and supervised classiﬁcation, previously studied in
isolation. From the perspective of dictionary learning, the
ﬁrst layer represents projectors to the discovered set of ba-
sis functions which are linearly combined by the second
layer to perform predictions [20]. Neurobiologically, this
allows delineating a low-dimensional manifold of brain
network patterns and then distinguishing mental tasks by
their most discriminative linear combinations. Theoreti-
cally, a reduction in model variance should be achieved
by resting-state autoencoders that privilege the most neu-
robiologically valid models in the hypothesis set. Practi-
cally, neuroimaging research frequently suffers from data
scarcity. This limits the set of representations that can be
extracted from GLM analyses based on few participants. We therefore contribute a computational
framework that 1) analyzes many problems simultaneously (thus ﬁnds shared representations by
“multi-task learning”) and 2) exploits unlabeled data (since they span a space of meaningful conﬁg-
urations).

Figure 1: Model architecture Linear
autoencoders ﬁnd an optimized com-
pression of 79,941 brain voxels into n
unknown activity patterns by improving
reconstruction from them. The decom-
position matrix equates with the bottle-
neck of a factored logistic regression.
Supervised multi-class learning on task
data (Xtask) can thus be guided by un-
supervised decomposition of rest data
(Xrest).

2 Methods

Data. As the currently biggest openly-accessible reference dataset, we chose resources from the
Human Connectome Project (HCP) [4]. Neuroimaging task data with labels of ongoing cognitive
processes were drawn from 500 healthy HCP participants (cf. Appendix for details on datasets). 18
HCP tasks were selected that are known to elicit reliable neural activity across participants (Table
1). In sum, the HCP task data incorporated 8650 ﬁrst-level activity maps from 18 diverse paradigms
administered to 498 participants (2 removed due to incomplete data). All maps were resampled to a
common 60 ⇥ 72 ⇥ 60 space of 3mm isotropic voxels and gray-matter masked (at least 10% tissue

2

probability). The supervised analyses were thus based on labeled HCP task maps with 79,941 voxels
of interest representing z-values in gray matter.

These labeled data were complemented by unlabeled activity maps from HCP acquisitions of uncon-
strained resting-state activity [25]. These reﬂect brain activity in the absence of controlled thought.
In sum, the HCP rest data concatenated 8000 unlabeled, noise-cleaned rest maps with 40 brain maps
from each of 200 randomly selected participants.
We were further interested in the utility of the optimized low-rank projection in one task dataset
for dimensionality reduction in another task dataset. To this end, the HCP-derived network decom-
positions were used as preliminary step in the classiﬁcation problem of another large sample. The
ARCHI dataset [21] provides activity maps from diverse experimental tasks, including auditory and
visual perception, motor action, reading, language comprehension and mental calculation. Analo-
gous to HCP data, the second task dataset thus incorporated 1404 labeled, grey-matter masked, and
z-scored activity maps from 18 diverse tasks acquired in 78 participants.

Linear autoencoder. The labeled and unlabeled data were fed into a linear statistical model com-
posed of an autoencoder and dimensionality-reducing logistic regression. The afﬁne autoencoder
takes the input x, projects it into a coordinate system of latent representations z and reconstructs it
back to x0 by

z = W0x + b0

x0 = W1z + b1,

(1)
where x 2 Rd denotes the vector of d = 79,941 voxel values from each rest map, z 2 Rn is the n-
dimensional hidden state (i.e., distributed neural activity patterns), and x0 2 Rd is the reconstruction
vector of the original activity map from the hidden variables. Further, W0 denotes the weight matrix
that transforms from input space into the hidden space (encoder), W1 is the weight matrix for back-
projection from the hidden variables to the output space (decoder). b0 and b1 are corresponding
bias vectors. The model parameters W0, b0, b1 are found by minimizing the expected squared
reconstruction error

E [LAE (x)] = E⇥kx   (W1(W0x + b0) + b1)k2⇤ .

(2)

Here we choose W0 and W1 to be tied, i.e. W0 = WT
1 . Consequently, the learned weights are
forced to take a two-fold function: That of signal analysis and that of signal synthesis. The ﬁrst
layer analyzes the data to obtain the cleanest latent representation, while the second layer represents
building blocks from which to synthesize the data using the latent activations. Tying these processes
together makes the analysis layer interpretable and pulls all non-zero singular values towards 1.
Nonlinearities were not applied to the activations in the ﬁrst layer.

Factored logistic regression. Our factored logistic regression model is best described as a variant
of a multinomial logistic regression. Speciﬁcally, the weight matrix is replaced by the product

3

of two weight matrices with a common latent dimension. The later is typically much lower than
the dimension of the data. Alternatively, this model can be viewed as a single-hidden-layer feed-
forward neural network with a linear activation function for the hidden layer and a softmax function
on the output layer. As the dimension of the hidden layer is much lower than the input layer, this
architecture is sometimes referred to as a “linear bottleneck” in the literature. The probability of an
input x to belong to a class i 2{ 1, . . . , l} is given by

P (Y = i|x; V0, V1, c0, c1) = softmaxi(fLR(x)),

(3)

where fLR(x) = V1(V0x + c0) + c1 computes multinomial
exp(xi)/Pj exp(xj). The matrix V0 2 Rdxn transforms the input x 2 Rd into n latent com-
ponents and the matrix V1 2 Rnxl projects the latent components onto hyperplanes that reﬂect l
label probabilities. c0 and c1 are bias vectors. The loss function is given by

logits and softmaxi(x) =

Layer combination. The optimization problem of the linear autoencoder and the factored logistic
regression are linked in two ways. First, their transformation matrices mapping from input to the
latent space are tied

(5)
We hence search for a compression of the 79,941 voxel values into n unknown components that
represent a latent code optimized for both rest and task activity data. Second, the objectives of the
autoencoder and the factored logistic regression are interpolated in the common loss function

V0 = W0.

In so doing, we search for the combined model parameters ✓ = {V0, V1, c0, c1, b0, b1} with
respect to the (unsupervised) reconstruction error and the (supervised) task detection. LAE is de-
vided by NXrest to equilibrate both loss terms to the same order of magnitude. ⌦ represents an
ElasticNet-type regularization that combines `1 and `2 penalty terms.

Optimization. The common objective was optimized by gradient descent in the SSFLogReg pa-
rameters. The required gradients were obtained by using the chain rule to backpropagate error
derivatives. We chose the rmsprop solver [27], a reﬁnement of stochastic gradient descent. Rmsprop
dictates an adaptive learning rate for each model parameter by scaled gradients from a running av-
erage. The batch size was set to 100 (given much expected redundancy in Xrest and Xtask), matrix
parameters were initalized by Gaussian random values multiplied by 0.004 (i.e., gain), and bias
parameters were initalized to 0.
The normalization factor and the update rule for ✓ are given by

v(t+1) = ⇢v(t) + (1   ⇢)⇣r✓f (x(t), y(t),✓ (t))⌘2

✓(t+1) = ✓(t) + ↵r✓f (x(t), y(t),✓ (t))

pv(t+1) + ✏

,

(7)

where f is the loss function computed on a minibatch sample at timestep t, ↵ is the learning rate
(0.00001), ✏ a global damping factor (10 6), and ⇢ the decay rate (0.9 to deemphasize the magni-
tude of the gradient). Note that we have also experimented with other solvers (stochastic gradient
descent, adadelta, and adagrad) but found that rmsprop converged faster and with similar or higher
generalization performance.

Implementation. The analyses were performed in Python. We used nilearn to handle the large
quantities of neuroimaging data [1] and Theano for automatic, numerically stable differentiation
of symbolic computation graphs [5, 7]. All Python scripts that generated the results are accessible
online for reproducibility and reuse (http://github.com/banilo/nips2015).

3 Experimental Results

Serial versus parallel structure discovery and classiﬁcation. We ﬁrst tested whether there is a
substantial advantage in combining unsupervised decomposition and supervised classiﬁcation learn-
ing. We benchmarked our approach against performing data reduction on the (unlabeled) ﬁrst half
of the HCP task data by PCA, SPCA, ICA, and AE (n = 5, 20, 50, 100 components) and learn-
ing classiﬁcation models in the (labeled) second half by ordinary logistic regression. PCA reduced
the dimensionality of the task data by ﬁnding orthogonal network components (whitening of the
data). SPCA separated the task-related BOLD signals into network components with few regions
by a regression-type optimization problem constrained by `1 penalty (no orthogonality assumptions,
1000 maximum iterations, per-iteration tolerance of 10-8, ↵ = 1). ICA performed iterative blind
source separation by a parallel FASTICA implementation (200 maximum iterations, per-iteration
tolerance of 0.0001, initialized by random mixing matrix, whitening of the data). AE found a code
of latent representations by optimizing projection into a bottleneck (500 iterations, same imple-
mentation as below for rest data). The second half of the task data was projected onto the latent
components discovered in its ﬁrst half. Only the ensuing component loadings were submitted to
ordinary logistic regression (no hidden layer, `1 = 0.1, `2 = 0.1, 500 iterations). These serial two-
step approaches were compared against parallel decomposition and classiﬁcation by SSFLogReg
(one hidden layers,   = 1, `1 = 0.1, `2 = 0.1, 500 iterations). Importantly, all trained classiﬁca-
tion models were tested on a large, unseen test set (20% of data) in the present analyses. Across
choices for n, SSFLogReg achieved more than 95% out-of-sample accuracy, whereas supervised
learning based on PCA, SPCA, ICA, and AE loadings ranged from 32% to 87% (Table 2). This
experiment establishes the advantage of directly searching for classiﬁcation-relevant structure in the
fMRI data, rather than solving the supervised and unsupervised problems independently. This effect
was particularly pronounced when assuming few hidden dimensions.

Model performance. SSFLogReg was subsequently trained (500 epochs) across parameter
choices for the hidden components (n = 5, 20, 100) and the balance between autoencoder and
logistic regression (  = 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1). Assuming 5 latent directions of variation should yield
models with higher bias and smaller variance than SSFLogReg with 100 latent directions. Given the
18-class problem of HCP, setting   to 0 consistently yields generalization performance at chance-
level (5,6%) because only the unsupervised layer of the estimator is optimized. At each epoch (i.e.,
iteration over the data), the out-of-sample performance of the trained classiﬁer was assessed on 20%
of unseen HCP data. Additionally, the “out-of-study” performance of the learned decomposition
(W0) was assessed by using it as dimensionality reduction of an independent labeled dataset (i.e.,
ARCHI) and conducting ordinary logistic regression on the ensuing component loadings.

We made three noteworthy observations (Table 3). First, the most supervised estimator (  = 1)
achieved in no instance the best accuracy, precision, recall, or f1 scores on HCP data. Classiﬁcation
by SSFLogReg is therefore facilitated by imposing structure from the unlabeled rest data. Conﬁrmed
by the normalized reconstruction error (E = kx   ˆxk/kxk), little weight on the supervised term is
sufﬁcient for good model performance while keeping E low and task-map decomposition rest-like.

Figure 2: Effect of bottleneck in a 38-task classiﬁcaton problem Depicts the f1 prediction scores
for each of 38 psychological tasks. Multinomial logistic regression operating in voxel space (blue
bars) was compared to SSFLogReg operating in 20 (left plot) and 100 (right plot) latent modes
(grey bars). Autoencoder or rest data were not used for these analyses (  = 1). Ordinary logistic
regression yielded 77.7% accuracy out of sample, while SSFLogReg scored at 94.4% (n = 20) and
94.2% (n = 100). Hence, compressing the voxel data into a component space for classiﬁcation
achieves higher task separability. Chance is at 2, 6%.

Second, the higher the number of latent components n, the higher the out-of-study performance with
small values of  . This suggests that the presence of more rest-data-inspired hidden components
results in more effective feature representations in unrelated task data. Third, for n = 20 and 100
(but not 5) the purely rest-data-trained decomposition matrix (  = 0) resulted in noninferior out-of-
study performance of 77.0% and 79.2%, respectively (Table 3). This conﬁrms that guiding model
learning by task-unrelated structure extracts features of general relevance beyond the supervised
problem at hand.

Individual effects of dimensionality reduction and rest data. We ﬁrst quantiﬁed the impact of
introducing a bottleneck layer disregarding the autoencoder. To this end, ordinary logistic regression
was juxtaposed with SSFLogReg at   = 1. For this experiment, we increased the difﬁculty of the
classiﬁcation problem by including data from all 38 HCP tasks. Indeed, increased class separability
in component space, as compared to voxel space, entails differences in generalization performance
of ⇡ 17% (Figure 2). Notably, the cognitive tasks on reward and punishment processing are among
the least predicted with ordinary but well predicted with low-rank logistic regression (tasks 1 and
2 in Figure 2). These experimental conditions have been reported to exhibit highly similar neural
activity patterns in GLM analyses of that dataset [4]. Consequently, also local activity differences (in
the striatum and visual cortex in this case) can be successfully captured by brain-network modelling.

We then contemplated the impact of rest structure (Figure 3) by modulating its inﬂuence (  =
0.25, 0.5, 0.75) in data-scarce and data-rich settings (n = 20, `1 = 0.1, `2 = 0.1). At the beginning
of every epoch, 2000 task and 2000 rest maps were drawn with replacement from same amounts of
task and rest maps. In data-scarce scenarios (frequently encountered by neuroimaging practitioners),
the out-of-sample scores improve as we depart from the most supervised model (  = 1). In data-rich
scenarios, we observed the same trend to be apparent.

Feature identiﬁcation. We ﬁnally examined whether the models were ﬁt for purpose (Figure 4).
To this end, we computed Pearson’s correlation between the classiﬁer weights and the averaged
neural activity map for each of the 18 tasks. Ordinary logistic regression thus yielded a mean cor-
relation of ⇢ = 0.28 across tasks. For SSFLogReg (  = 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1), a per-class-weight map
was computed by matrix multiplication of the two inner layers. Feature identiﬁcation performance
thus ranged between ⇢ = 0.35 and ⇢ = 0.55 for n = 5, between ⇢ = 0.59 and ⇢ = 0.69 for n = 20,
and between ⇢ = 0.58 and ⇢ = 0.69 for n = 100. Consequently, SSFLogReg puts higher absolute
weights on relevant structure. This reﬂects an increased signal-to-noise ratio, in part explained by

Figure 3: Effect of rest structure Model performance of SSFLogReg (n = 20, `1 = 0.1, `2 = 0.1)
for different choices of   in data-scarce (100 task and 100 rest maps, hot color) and data-rich (1000
task and 1000 rest maps, cold color) scenarios. Gradient descent was performed on 2000 task and
2000 rest maps. At the begining of each epoch, these were drawn with replacement from a pool of
100 or 1000 different task and rest maps, respectively. Chance is at 5.6%.

all samples of whole-brain activity maps from each task. SSFLogReg a) puts higher absolute weights
on relevant structure, b) lower ones on irrelevant structure, and c) yields BOLD-typical local con-
tiguity (without enforcing an explicit spatial prior). All values are z-scored and thresholded at the
75th percentile.

the more BOLD-typical local contiguity. Conversely, SSFLogReg puts lower probability mass on
irrelevant structure. Despite lower interpretability of the results from ordinary logistic regression,
the salt-and-pepper-like weight maps were sufﬁcient for good classiﬁcation performance. Hence,
SSFLogReg yielded class weights that were much more similar to features of the respective training
samples for all choices of n and  . SSFLogReg therefore captures genuine properties of task activity
patterns, rather than participant- or study-speciﬁc artefacts.

Miscellaneous observations. For the sake of completeness, we informally report modiﬁcations of
the statistical model that did not improve generalization performance. a) Introducing stochasticity
into model learning by input corruption of Xtask deteriorated model performance in all scenarios.
Adding b) rectiﬁed linear units (ReLU) to W0 or other commonly used nonlinearities (c) sigmoid,
d) softplus, e) hyperbolic tangent) all led to decreased classiﬁcation accuracies, probably due to
sample size limits. Further, f ) “pretraining” of the bottleneck W0 (i.e., non-random initialization)
by either corresponding PCA, SPCA or ICA loadings did not exhibit improved accuracies, neither
did g) autoencoder pretraining. Moreover, introducing an additional h) overcomplete layer (100
units) after the bottleneck was not advantageous. Finally, imposing either i) only `1 or j) only `2
penalty terms was disadvantageous in all tested cases. This favored ElasticNet regularization chosen
in the above analyses.

4 Discussion and Conclusion

Using the ﬂexibility of factored models, we learn the low-dimensional representation from high-
dimensional voxel brain space that is most important for prediction of cognitive task sets. From
a machine-learning perspective, factorization of the logistic regression weights can be viewed as
transforming a “multi-class classiﬁcation problem” into a “multi-task learning problem”. The higher
generalization accuracy and support recovery, comparing to ordinary logistic regression, hold po-
tential for adoption in various neuroimaging analyses. Besides increased performance, these models
are more interpretable by automatically learning a mapping to and from a brain-network space. This
domain-speciﬁc learning algorithm encourages departure from the artiﬁcial and statistically less at-
tractive voxel space. Neurobiologically, brain activity underlying deﬁned mental operations can be
explained by linear combinations of the main activity patterns. That is, fMRI data probably con-
centrate near a low-dimensional manifold of characteristic brain network combinations. Extracting
fundamental building blocks of brain organization might facilitate the quest for the cognitive prim-
itives of human thought. We hope that these ﬁrst steps stimulate development towards powerful
semi-supervised representation extraction in systems neuroscience.
In the future, automatic reduction of brain maps to their neurobiological essence may leverage data-
intense neuroimaging investigations. Initiatives for data collection are rapidly increasing in neu-
roscience [22]. These promise structured integration of neuroscientiﬁc knowledge accumulating
in databases. Tractability by condensed feature representations can avoid the ill-posed problem
of learning the full distribution of activity patterns. This is not only relevant to the multi-class
challenges spanning the human cognitive space [24] but also the multi-modal combination with
high-resolution 3D models of brain anatomy [2] and high-throughput genomics [19]. The biggest
socioeconomic potential may lie in across-hospital clinical studies that predict disease trajectories
and drug responses in psychiatric and neurological populations [11].
